Customized plan to suit your needs. Send us an email to [contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io).

## On-demand resources

You can upgrade the app's resources (CPUs, RAM, GPUs). You'll be billed per-second,
and you can downgrade the hardware at any time.

We're beta testing on-demand resources. If you want to use it, send us an email to [contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io).
