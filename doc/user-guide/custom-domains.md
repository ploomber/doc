# Custom domains/subdomains

```{important}
Custom domains/subdomains are only available to customers in the Pro, Teams and Enterprise plans.
```

Each application gets a unique URL in the format `project-id.ploomber.app` or `project-id.ploomberapp.io`, where project-id is an automatically generated identifier.

```{important}
We are slowly migrating all new applications to `ploomber.app`, but some existing apps are still on `ploomberapp.io`.
```

You can customize the [`project-id`](custom-ploomber-subdomain) or bring your [own domain](custom-domain) or [custom subdomain](custom-subdomain).

(custom-ploomber-subdomain)=
## `{custom}.ploomber.app` and `{custom}.ploomberapp.io`

If you would like a custom `ploomber.app` or `ploomberapp.io` subdomain, like `my-custom-app.ploomberapp.io`, you can add it during application setup:

(custom-domain)=
## Adding a custom domain

To deploy an app at `yourdomain.com`, ensure it's deployed and available (the **VIEW APPLICATION** button should be enabled):

![](../static/custom-domains/view-application.png)

```{warning}
If your application is not ready and publicly available, the button will be disabled and you won't be able to connect a custom domain to it.
```

Go to the application settings page by clicking on `...` and then, on the **SETTINGS** button:

![](../static/custom-domains/settings-button.png)

Next, in the **Custom domains** section, enter your domain, and click **CONNECT**:

![](../static/custom-domains/custom-domains-section.png)


A new window will display showing the DNS records you need to add ([see the updating your DNS records](update-dns-records) section for instructions):

![](../static/custom-domains/pointing-change-dns-records.png)

```{important}
We are slowly migrating all new applications to `ploomber.app`, but some existing apps are still on `ploomberapp.io`. Make sure your DNS records match the domain associated with your application.
```

You must add three DNS records:

1. A `ALIAS` record: `@` as host, and `yourapp.ploomberapp.io` (or `yourapp.ploomber.app`) as value (replace `yourapp` with your actual app ID)
2. A `CNAME` record: `www` as host, and `yourapp.ploomberapp.io` (or `yourapp.ploomber.app`) as value (replace `yourapp` with your actual app ID)
3. A `CNAME` record: with the shown **CNAME name** and **CNAME value** (as displayed in the **SSL certification status** section)

```{important}
Some DNS providers don't support `ALIAS` records. If that's your case, you might try adding a `CNAME` record. If you
need assistance, [contact us](mailto:contact@ploomber.io)
```

(godaddy-redirect)=
### GoDaddy Redirection

Since GoDaddy doesn't support Alias, as well as a non-IP for the CNAME root domain, you will need to configure a subdomain with www.yourdomain.com and redirect the traffic from your top domain (`yourdomain.com`) to it. To do so:

1. Create a `www` [custom subdomain](custom-subdomain).
2. Update your DNS according to the instructions for this new subdomain `www.yourdomain.com`.
3. Set up a Forwarding Rule to your Subdomain, of type `Permanent (301)` redirect.

![1-forwarding-rule](../static/custom-domains/godaddy_redirect_1.png)
![2-forwarding-rule](../static/custom-domains/godaddy_redirect_2.png)

```{important}
For this to work, make sure to generate a new **subdomain** for your `www.yourdomain.com`, since the SSL certificate generated for the top domain doesn't cover the www subdomain in case of a redirect.
```

So when looking at the current domain configured for your application, you should see `www.yourdomain.com` and not `yourdomain.com`, as seen below:

![3-forwarding-rule](../static/custom-domains/godaddy_redirect_3.png)


(custom-subdomain)=
## Adding a custom subdomain

To deploy an app at `subdomain.yourdomain.com`, you first need to ensure it's deployed and available (the **VIEW APPLICATION** button should be enabled)

![](../static/custom-domains/view-application.png)

```{warning}
If your application is not ready and publicly available, the button will be disabled and you won't be able to connect a custom subdomain to it.
```

Go to the application settings page by clicking on `...` and then, on the **SETTINGS** button:

![](../static/custom-domains/settings-button.png)

Next, in the **Custom domains** section, enter the subdomain, for example: `subdomain.yourdomain.com`.

![](../static/custom-domains/subdomain-settings.png)

Then, click `CONNECT`:

![](../static/custom-domains/subdomain-settings-selected.png)

A new window will display showing the DNS records you need to add ([see the updating your DNS records](update-dns-records) section for instructions):

![](../static/custom-domains/subdomain-dns.png)


You must add two records:

1. `CNAME` record: the subdomain you want to add as the host (e.g., if you want to connect `subdomain.yourdomain.com`, then, you must enter `subdomain`) and `yourapp.ploomberapp.io` (or `yourapp.ploomber.app` dependending on your application domain) as value (where `yourapp` is the ID assigned to your application)
2. `CNAME` record: with the shown **CNAME name** and **CNAME value** (as displayed in the **SSL certification status** section)


(update-dns-records)=
## Updating DNS records

```{note}
If you have issues modifying your DNS records, send us an email ([contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io)) and we'll help you. You might also check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting-dns) section.
```

To modify your DNS records, follow these instructions (they apply to Namecheap but they're similar for other DNS providers):

1. Log in to your [Namecheap account](https://www.namecheap.com/)

2. Click `Domain List` tab and then click `Manage` button next to your domain

![](../static/custom-domains/namecheap-domains.png)

3. Click `Advanced DNS`

![](../static/custom-domains/namecheap-advanced-dns.png)

4. Add the relevant DNS records, and click `Save all changed`.

You should be able to see something like this:

![](../static/custom-domains/namecheap-updated-dns-records.png)


```{important}
Depending on your DNS provider (e.g. SquareSpace, and previously Namecheap), you might need to modify the CNAME
record displayed for the SSL certificate. You'll see something like this
in the CNAME name: 
- `_LONGSTRING.example.com.` → `_LONGSTING` 
- `_LONGSTRING.subdomain.example.com.` → `_LONGSTRING`

If you encounter errors, remove the root domain from the value. (see this
[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63246970/709975) question to learn more)
```


```{important}
DNS record changes might take up to 48 hours to take effect. In the meantime, your application will be accessible from the `ploomber.app` or `ploomberapp.io` URL
```

## Moving an existing domain/subdomain to another app

If you configured an app with a custom domain/subdomain and you want to move to another
app, follow these instructions.

First, go to the app that has the domain/subdomain configured and click on the `+` button:

![1-existing-config](../static/custom-domains/move-domain/1-existing-config.png)

Click on `DELETE`:

![2-delete](../static/custom-domains/move-domain/2-delete.png)

Confirm deletion:

![3-delete-confirm](../static/custom-domains/move-domain/3-delete-confirm.png)

Now, go to the new app and register the domain/subdomain, this will display the DNS
records:

![4-new-dns-records](../static/custom-domains/move-domain/4-new-dns-records.png)

Finally, update your DNS records. In this example, we've migrated a subdomain
(`app.mydomain.com`), you
can see that this requires me to add 2 DNS records. This is how my DNS records
look:


![5-existing-dns-records](../static/custom-domains/move-domain/5-existing-dns-records.png)


Since I've configured the old app (`sweet-hall-4443`) with the given subdomain, I'll have to update the
existing CNAME record where `Host=app` (the first record), so it matches the ID of my
new app (`rough-base-8214`).

(troubleshooting-dns)=
## Troubleshooting DNS errors

These are the most common errors.

### Server Not Found

![](../static/custom-domains/domains-server-not-found.png)

You'll see this error if you're missing the DNAME record that points from your domain (or subdomain) to the  `ID.ploomber.app` or `ID.ploomberapp.io` URL (depending on your application domain), ensure you add it. Give it some time since DNS records take some time to update. If issues persist, contact us at [contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io).


### Potential Security Risk Ahead

![](../static/custom-domains/domains-ssl-error.png)

If you see this error (or a related one), it's most likely because you're missing the CNAME record to emit the SSL certificate:

![](../static/custom-domains/ssl-cname-record.png)

Ensure you add it and give it some time since DNS records take some time to update. If issues persist, contact us at [contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io).

## Configuring a CAA record

Note that Ploomber Cloud uses AWS for generating and issuing certificates. If you are using a DNS registrar that doesn't allow Amazon to issue certificates from their side (e.g., Hostinger), you need to configure Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS records.
A Certification Authority Authorization ([CAA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/setup-caa.html)) DNS record specifies that AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is allowed to issue a certificate for your domain or subdomain.

Here are the records that you need to add:

```text
Type: CAA
Name: @
Flag: 0
Tag: issue
CA domain: "amazon.com"
TTL: 60
```

```text
Type: CAA
Name: @
Flag: 0
Tag: issuewild
CA domain: "amazon.com"
TTL: 60
```
