# Command-line interface

You can deploy applications using the command-line interface. First, install the package:

```sh
pip install ploomber-cloud
```

Then, set your API key ([learn how to get it](../quickstart/apikey.md)):

```sh
ploomber-cloud key YOURKEY
```

You can also set your API key by setting the environment variable:

```sh
export PLOOMBER_CLOUD_KEY=YOURKEY
```

```{tip}

`pc` is a shortcut for `ploomber-cloud`. Example: `pc key`
```

(init)=
## Initialize a new app

If you want to create a new app, run the `init` command:

```sh
ploomber-cloud init
```

This will prompt you for the project type (if this is a Docker-based project and you already have a `Dockerfile`, it'll ask you for confirmation).

Once the command exits, you can deploy:

```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

The `deploy` command will print a URL that you can visit to track deployment progress. If you would like to track progress in the command line,
you can add the `--watch` flag or the `--watch-incremental` flag.

```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy --watch
```

```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy --watch-incremental
```

When deploying from the terminal, it's recommended to use the `--watch` option. This flag clears the terminal before printing updated logs, ensuring a clean display. Alternatively, if you're storing deployment output in a file, such as with GitHub Actions, opt for `--watch-incremental`. This option skips clearing the screen and only prints new logs and status updates.


(config)=
## Configure an existing project

If you want to deploy an existing project, run the `init` command with the `--from-existing` flag to download this one:

```sh
ploomber-cloud init --from-existing
```

This command will:

1. Prompt you to choose from a list of your existing projects.
2. Create a new directory named after your project ID (e.g., `./cool-tree-1860/`).
3. Download the project files into this new directory.
4. Generate a ploomber-cloud.json file with your project's information.


For example, if your app ID is `cool-tree-1860` and you're deploying a Docker app, the `./cool-tree-1860/ploomber-cloud.json` file might look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "cool-tree-1860",
    "type": "docker"
}
```

After initializing, you can deploy your project by going into this new directory:
```sh
cd cool-tree-1860
```

Then, execute:
```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

**Optional Configuration**:
You can use the `--config` flag with the `ploomber-cloud init --from-existing` command to specify a custom name for the configuration file instead of the default `ploomber-cloud.json`. When using this flag for downloading your project, only the file name will be considered, regardless of any specified path. For example:
```sh
ploomber-cloud init --from-existing --config ./specific-path/custom-config.json
```

This will create a configuration file named `custom-config.json` in the root of the downloaded project directory.

## Download Configuration Only
If you want to download only the configuration file without the project code, use the --only-config flag:

```sh
ploomber-cloud init --from-existing --only-config
```

This will generate only the ploomber-cloud.json file in your current directory, without creating a new project directory or downloading the project files.


**Optional Configuration**:
You can use the `--config` flag in combination with `--only-config` to specify a custom name and location for the configuration file:
```sh
ploomber-cloud init --from-existing --only-config --config path/to/custom-config.json
```
This allows you to choose a different name for the configuration file and the specify a different location to save the file.

## Force initialize an app

You might want to re-initialize your project in case the `ploomber-cloud.json` file has got corrupted or doesn't contain the valid keys.

Then run the `init` command with the `--force` flag:

```sh
ploomber-cloud init --force
```

This will replace the existing `ploomber-cloud.json` with a new one, with a different `id` field.

It can also be combined with the `--from-existing` and `--only-config` for re-initializing from an existing project:

```sh
ploomber-cloud init --from-existing --only-config --force 
```

## Ignore a file or directory

You can choose to ignore any file or directory by adding a list in the `ignore` field in `ploomber-cloud.json`. These files will not be included in the uploaded zip file. Format of ignored files or directories:
- `name`: all files or folders with `name`
- `dir/`: all files or folders in folder with name `dir`
- `dir/file` and `dir/dir/`: all files/folders with the specified path relative to root

Example:

```json
{
    "id": "cool-tree-1860",
    "type": "docker",
    "ignore": [
        "ignore.txt",
        "ignore_dir/",
        "dir/ignore2.txt"
    ]
}
```

## Delete an app

For deleting a particular app run the `delete` command with the `--project-id` flag:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud delete --project-id <project-id>
```

You can also delete a project without passing the ID by running the delete command from within the initialized project folder:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud delete
```

To delete all apps:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud delete --all
```

It should display a confirmation message:

```
Are you sure you want to delete all projects?
This action is irreversible and cannot be undone.
Pressing forward with this will result in a loss of all project data and configurations.
If you're unsure or wish to reconsider, please cancel immediately by pressing Ctrl + C. [y/N]: 
```

Confirm with `y` to delete all projects in your account.

## Deploying an example

Ploomber Cloud hosts example applications for many different frameworks. To download and deploy one, run `ploomber-cloud examples`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud examples
```

Follow the prompts to choose a framework and specific example name. You may also specify a directory in which to download the example.

Once the application is downloaded, it's ready to deploy! For example, if you downloaded the `basic-app` example for `Flask` in the current directory:

```sh
ploomber-cloud key YOUR-KEY
cd basic-app
ploomber-cloud init
ploomber-cloud deploy --watch
```

If you already know which example you want, you can download it while avoiding prompts with `ploomber-cloud examples framework/example-name`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud examples flask/basic-app
```

A full list of example applications is available [here](https://github.com/bryannho/doc/tree/main/examples)

Note that the examples metadata is cached. If you are having trouble finding a recently added example you can invalidate the cache by passing the `--clear-cache` flag:

```sh
ploomber-cloud examples flask/some-new-app --clear-cache
```

## Monitor a deployment

An application deployment can be monitored by using the `watch` command by passing a `project-id` and an optional `job-id`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud watch --project-id <project-id> --job-id <job-id>
```

You should be able to find the parameters from the deployment message. Here's an example:

```
The deployment process started! Track its status at: https://www.platform.ploomber.io/applications/muddy-art-3373/8d1067be
```

Here, `project-id` is `muddy-art-3373` and `job-id` is `8d1067be`.

## Retrieve application logs

You can retrieve app logs during or after deployment using the `logs` command. You must pass a `project-id` or `job-id`. 

For example, if your `project-id` was `lucky-sea-1234` and `job-id` was `0a2d4az5`, you could grab the logs using `--project-id`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud logs --project-id lucky-sea-1234
```

or using `--job-id`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud logs --job-id 0a2d4az5
```

Note that if you pass both `--project-id` and `--job-id`, the __job-id__ will be prioritized.

By default the command will print both the `docker` logs and `webservice` logs, but you can specify a single set of logs using the `--type` option. Available types are: `docker` or `web`:

```sh
ploomber-cloud logs --project-id <project-id> --type docker
```

```sh
ploomber-cloud logs --project-id <project-id> --type web
```


## Configure an application using a template

You can configure an application using a pre-defined template by running the command:

```sh
ploomber-cloud templates <template-name>
```
 
This command should be run in an empty folder. 

Currently only the `vllm` and `auth0` templates are supported.
- To learn more about deploying vLLM, [click here.](../apps/vllm.md) 
- To learn about adding Auth0 to your app, [click here.](../user-guide/password.md#auth0-authentication)

## Configure GitHub action

If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can configure an action for triggering project deployment everytime code changes are pushed.

For configuring a GitHub action through CLI run the command:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud github
```

On confirming with `y` the CLI will create a `ploomber-cloud.yaml` file in the path `.github/workflows`. 
[Click here](../user-guide/github.md#configure-action-through-cli) to learn more about configuring a GitHub action.


## Defining secrets

If your project uses secrets, you can define them in an `.env` file.

```{important}
If you are deploying using GitHub actions, **do not** upload your `.env` file to GitHub. Instead, follow the instructions [here.](../user-guide/github.md#secrets)
```

In your main project directory, create an `.env` file. Open it in your code editor, and enter your secrets. It should look like this:

```
MY_SECRET_1=value_1
MY_SECRET_2=value_2
```

Now make sure your project has been [initialized](init), and deploy it:

```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

The command-line interface will automatically read and encrypt your secrets and include them in the deployment.
For security reasons, your `.env` file is replaced with an empty file at runtime. Ploomber only stores your encrypted secrets.

To learn how to read your secrets from within your application, see [Reading secrets.](../user-guide/secrets.md#reading-secrets)

### Without an `.env` file

You may also define secrets in your `ploomber-cloud.json` and Ploomber Cloud will read them from your environment variables. Here are the steps:

1. Set secrets as environment variables using `export key=value`
2. Define secret keys in `ploomber-cloud.json` under `secret-keys`
3. Deploy via `ploomber-cloud deploy`

For example, if I had two secrets, `key1` and `key2`, I would first set them as environment variables:

```sh
export key1=val1
export key2=val2
```

Then I would edit my `ploomber-cloud.json` to look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "project-id-1999",
    "type": "project-type",
    "secret-keys": ["key1", "key2"]
}
```

Now run `ploomber-cloud deploy`. You should see the secrets included with this message:

```
Adding the following secrets to the app: key1, key2,
```

Some important notes:

- `secret-keys` should be defined as a list of strings that only includes the keys (not the values) of each secret
- If your secrets are defined in both an `.env` and `secret-keys`, the deployment will fail. You may only use one method.
- Make sure to define each secret as an environment variable AND in your `ploomber-cloud.json`. 
    - If a secret is defined in `ploomber-cloud.json` but isn't set as an environment variable, the deployment will fail. 
    - If a secret is set as an environment variable but isn't defined in `ploomber-cloud.json`, that secret won't be included in the deployment.

## Password protection

```{tip}
For enterprise-grade authentication, see: [Auth0 authentication](auth0-integration)
```

To add basic username/password protection to your app:

```bash
ploomber-cloud auth --add --feature main_app

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

If you want to add authentication to the analytics dashboard:

```bash
ploomber-cloud auth --add --feature analytics

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

### Updating credentials

```sh
ploomber-cloud auth --overwrite --add --feature main_app

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

If you want to update the credentials for the analytics dashboard:

```sh
ploomber-cloud auth --overwrite --add --feature analytics

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

### Removing credentials

```sh
ploomber-cloud auth --remove --feature main_app

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```

If you want to remove credentials for the analytics dashboard:

```sh
ploomber-cloud auth --remove --feature analytics

# deploy the app to apply the changes
ploomber-cloud deploy
```


## Configure resources

You can customize the amount of `CPUs`, `RAM`, and `GPUs` that your project will use with this command:

```sh
ploomber-cloud resources
```

If your `ploomber-cloud.json` file already has a `resources` section, you can reconfigure with the `--force` flag:

```sh
ploomber-cloud resources --force
```

### Carrying over resources

When you initialize a project using `--force` or `--from-existing`, your resources are carried over.

`ploomber-cloud init --force` will carry over the resources from the `ploomber-cloud.json` file.

`ploomber-cloud init --from-existing` and `ploomber-cloud init --from-existing --force` will carry over the resources that the project was most recently deployed with.

If you run any of these commands, be sure to double check your resources by checking the `ploomber-cloud.json` or running `ploomber-cloud resources`.
You can easily reconfigure them with:

```sh
ploomber-cloud resources --force
```

## Add labels

You can add labels to your project by running: 

```sh 
ploomber-cloud labels --add label_1 -a label_2
```

The labels will be added to the `ploomber-cloud.json` file like so:

```json
{
    "id": "broken-night-1393",
    "type": "dash",
    "labels": [
        "dash",
        "simple"
    ]
}
```

Labels can be added either after `ploomber-cloud init` or `ploomber-cloud deploy`. Once the project is deployed the labels will reflect in the UI:

![](../static/labels.png)

When you initialize a project using `--force`, the labels already configured will be carried over.

### Delete labels

To delete a label you can run:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud labels --delete label_1 -d label_2
```

You can also add and delete labels at the same time:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud labels --add label_1 --delete label_2
```

### View labels

To view all labels added to your project simply run:

```sh 
ploomber-cloud labels
```

### Synchronize labels

To overwrite the labels in your `ploomber-cloud.json` with the labels from the UI:

```sh
ploomber-cloud labels --sync
```

## Switching the configuration file

By default, the CLI reads and writes to a `ploomber-cloud.json` file, but you can customize it via the `--config` (or its short version, `-c`), switching the config file is useful when you need to manage multiple environments (for example, development and production).

All commands that read or write the config file accept the `--config/-c` argument. You can use this option to specify both alternative file names and paths, for example:

```sh
# create the config file in ploomber-cloud.dev.json
ploomber-cloud init --config ploomber-cloud.dev.json

# deploy using the dev config
ploomber-cloud deploy --config ploomber-cloud.dev.json
```

For more details on configuring projects, refer to [this section](config).


## Start/Stop apps

```{versionadded} 0.3.1
```

If you want to start or stop traffic to your apps, you can use the following commands:

```sh
ploomber-cloud start --project-id PROJECT_ID
ploomber-cloud stop --project-id PROJECT_ID
```

Where `PROJECT_ID` is the randomly generated ID. If you did not set a custom name,
the `PROJECT_ID` is the string in the URL (either `PROJECT_ID.ploomber.app` or `PROJECT_ID.ploomberapp.io`), if you set
a custom name, you can retrieve the `PROJECT_ID` by clicking on the ⚙️ icon next to the
URL in your app detailed view.


## Dev mode

```{versionadded} 0.4.2
```

Enable live dev mode for automatic deployment on source changes. When you save a file, the CLI uploads the modified file, and you can see the changes at `<project-id>.ploomber.app`.

If you modify `requirements.txt`, the CLI installs the new dependencies and restarts the app automatically.

To start Dev Mode, run from your project folder:

```sh
ploomber-cloud dev
```
